    "text": "Stat-515-002 (Spring 2024)\nGroup Number: 14\n\n\n\nColumns Used:\n\nCrash_Date:\n\nRationale for Use: The specific date and time of each crash incident are crucial for temporal analysis and trend identification.\n\nYear (Derived from Crash_Date):\n\nRationale for Use: Grouping the data by year enables the identification of yearly patterns and trends in crash occurrences.\n\nNum_Crashes (Derived from counting the number of records for each year):\n\nRationale for Use: Quantifying the crash frequency provides a clear measure for understanding the magnitude of road accidents over time.\n\n\n\nExplanation of the Code: This visualizes the frequency of crashes per year using ggplot2 in R. Initially, it converts the “Crash_Date” column into a date format and extracts the year from it. Then, it groups the data by year and calculates the number of crashes that occurred each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns Used:\n\nLongitude: Longitude coordinates are essential for accurately positioning each incident on the map.\nLatitude: Latitude coordinates complement longitude for precise incident mapping.\nReport.Number: Each incident is uniquely identified by a report number, facilitating individual incident reference and tracking.\n\n\nExplanation of the Code: This utilizes the Leaflet package in R to generate an interactive map. It begins by loading Leaflet and then initializes a map object. Using latitude and longitude data from a dataframe named ‘data’, it places circle markers on the map to represent specific locations, like crash sites. Each marker includes a popup and label showing the associated report number. Finally, it prints the interactive map, allowing users to explore the locations and corresponding report numbers within the R environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns Used:\n\nVehicle.Make: This column is used to group the data by vehicle make, as we want to count the number of accidents for each vehicle make.\ncount: This column is created using summarise() to count the number of accidents for each vehicle make group. It represents the frequency of accidents for each vehicle make. ::: {style=“text-align:justify”} Explanation of the Code: This generates a bar plot showing the top 10 most common vehicle makes involved in accidents, with vehicle make names on the y-axis and the number of accidents on the x-axis. It uses dplyr to summarize and arrange the data, then ggplot2 for visualization.Hypothesis: :::\n\n\n\n\nThe code you provided performs a chi-square test of independence to determine whether there is a statistically significant association between weather condition, light condition, and injury severity in traffic accidents. Here’s an explanation of why this test was conducted and what was observed:\nChi-Square Test of Independence: The chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. In this case, the variables of interest are weather condition, light condition, and injury severity.\nObservation: By analyzing the contingency table generated from the data, which shows the frequency distribution of the combinations of weather condition, light condition, and injury severity, we can observe the following:\n\nThe contingency table provides counts of the number of accidents for each combination of weather condition, light condition, and injury severity.\nThe chi-square test is then applied to assess whether these variables are independent of each other or if there is a relationship between them.\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results: The question is asking if there’s any relationship between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity in accidents. To analyze this, a Pearson’s Chi-squared test was conducted on the contingency table. The output indicates a significant relationship between these variables, with a very low p-value (p &lt; 2.2e-16). This suggests that the observed frequencies of injury severity across different weather conditions and daylight statuses are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, indicating a strong association between these factors.\n\n\n\n\nThe code aims to determine whether certain types of vehicles are more likely to be involved in collisions at night compared to during the day. Here’s a clear interpretation of the analysis:\n\nSubset Data: The dataset is divided into two subsets: collisions occurring during the day (collisions_day) and collisions occurring at night with lights on (collisions_night).\nCount Vehicle Types: Counts of each vehicle type involved in collisions are calculated separately for day and night collisions.\n\nChi-Square Test: A chi-square test of independence is performed to assess whether there is a significant association between vehicle types and the time of the collision (day or night).\n\n\nInterpretation of Results: The question is investigating whether certain types of vehicles are more prone to being involved in collisions at night compared to during the day. To analyze this, a Pearson’s Chi-squared test was conducted comparing the counts of collisions involving different types of vehicles during the day and at night. The output indicates that there is no significant difference in the distribution of collisions across different types of vehicles between day and night, with a p-value of 0.2408. This suggests that the likelihood of different types of vehicles being involved in collisions is similar during both day and night.\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis aims to determine whether drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher rate of collisions compared to drivers distracted by other factors. Here’s a clear interpretation of the results:\n\nData Subset: The dataset is divided into two subsets: one for drivers distracted by electronic devices (electronic_distracted) and another for drivers distracted by other factors (other_distracted).\nCount Collisions: The number of collisions is counted separately for drivers distracted by electronic devices and those distracted by other factors.\nChi-Square Test: A chi-square test of independence is performed to assess whether there is a significant difference in collision rates between the two groups of drivers.\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results: The question aims to determine if drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher collision rate compared to those distracted by other factors. To analyze this, a Chi-squared test was conducted comparing the collision counts between drivers distracted by electronic devices and those distracted by other factors. The output indicates a significant difference between the two groups, with a very low p-value (p &lt; 2.2e-16). This suggests that drivers distracted by electronic devices indeed have a significantly higher collision rate compared to those distracted by other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph :\n\n\nInterpretation of Results: The question investigates whether different types of traffic control measures are effective in reducing collision rates and which ones are most effective. To analyze this, a Pearson’s Chi-squared test was conducted between the types of traffic control measures and the severity of injuries resulting from collisions. The output shows a significant relationship between the two variables, with a very low p-value (p &lt; 2.2e-16). This suggests that the effectiveness of traffic control measures in preventing collisions varies significantly across different types. However, further analysis would be needed to determine which specific types of traffic controls are most effective in reducing collision rates and severity of injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results: The question aims to predict the severity of injuries resulting from collisions based on various factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision types. The output is from a random forest classification model trained on a dataset (train_data). The model’s accuracy is approximately 80.69%, indicating its ability to predict injury severity.\nThe confusion matrix shows how well the model predicts each class of injury severity. Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics provide further insight into the model’s performance for each class. However, for certain classes like “FATAL INJURY”, precision, recall, and F1-score are not defined (NaN), indicating that the model did not correctly predict any instances of that class.\nThe confusion matrix reveals the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. Additionally, the importance of variables in predicting injury severity is shown through MeanDecreaseGini values. In this case, “Collision.Type” has the highest importance, followed by “Weather” and “Surface.Condition”.\nOverall, the output suggests that weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision types are significant factors in predicting the severity of injuries resulting from collisions, with “Collision.Type” being the most important predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results: The output shows the performance of a model that predicts the extent of vehicle damage in collisions. It’s about 45% accurate overall. The model is better at predicting certain types of damage, like “DISABLING,” but not so good at others, like “DESTROYED” or “NO DAMAGE.” The confusion matrix gives details on predictions versus actual outcomes. The most crucial factors for prediction are collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit. Collision type is the most important, followed by vehicle movement and speed limit."

However, for certain classes like “FATAL INJURY”, precision, recall, and F1-score are not defined (NaN), indicating that the model did not correctly predict any instances of that class.\nThe confusion matrix reveals the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. Additionally, the importance of variables in predicting injury severity is shown through MeanDecreaseGini values. In this case, “Collision.Type” has the highest importance, followed by “Weather” and “Surface.Condition”.\nOverall, the output suggests that weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision types are significant factors in predicting the severity of injuries resulting from collisions, with “Collision.Type” being the most important predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results: The output shows the performance of a model that predicts the extent of vehicle damage in collisions. It’s about 45% accurate overall. The model is better at predicting certain types of damage, like “DISABLING,” but not so good at others, like “DESTROYED” or “NO DAMAGE.” The confusion matrix gives details on predictions versus actual outcomes. The most crucial factors for prediction are collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit. Collision type is the most important, followed by vehicle movement and speed limit."
