## **Research Questions:**

#### **Visualization**1: Crash Frequency per Year

#### **Visualization**2: Map vs. Deaths

#### **Visualization**3: Top 10 Most car accidents

#### **Hypothesis #1:** Is there any relation between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity?

#### **Hypothesis #2:** Are certain types of vehicles more likely to be involved in collisions at night compared to during the day?

#### **Hypothesis #3:** Do drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher rate of collisions compared to drivers distracted by other factors?

#### **Hypothesis #4:** Can we determine the effectiveness of different traffic control measures in reducing collision rates? Which types of traffic controls are most effective in preventing collisions?

### Prediction #1: Can we predict the severity of injuries based on various factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision type?

### Prediction #2: Can we predict the extent of vehicle damage in collisions based on collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit?

## **Methodologies:**

1.**Crash Frequency per Year:**

-   Utilizes ggplot2 in R to visualize the frequency of crashes per year by transforming the Crash_Date column into a date format and grouping the data by year.

2.**Map vs. Deaths**:

-   Utilizes the Leaflet package in R to create an interactive map displaying crash locations and associated fatalities using latitude and longitude data.

3.**Top 10 Most car accidents**:

-   Generates a bar plot using ggplot2 to showcase the top 10 most common vehicle makes involved in accidents, using dplyr for data summarization and arrangement.

4.**Hypothesis #1:**

-   **Relationship between Weather Conditions, Daylight, and Injury Severity** - Conducts a Pearson's Chi-squared test on a contingency table to analyze the association between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity.

5.**Hypothesis #2:**

-   **Vehicle Types and Collision Occurrence during Day and Night** - Performs a Pearson's Chi-squared test comparing collision counts involving different types of vehicles during the day and at night.

6.**Hypothesis #3:**

-   **Effect of Electronic Device Distraction on Collision Rate** - Conducts a Chi-squared test comparing collision counts between drivers distracted by electronic devices and those distracted by other factors.

7.**Hypothesis #4:**

-   **Effectiveness of Traffic Control Measures in Collision Prevention** - Conducts a Pearson's Chi-squared test between traffic control measures and injury severity to assess effectiveness and identify the most impactful measures.

8.**Prediction #1:**

-   **Severity of Injuries Based on Various Factors** - Utilizes a random forest classification model trained on relevant dataset to predict injury severity.

9.**Prediction #2:**

-   **Extent of Vehicle Damage in Collisions** - Evaluates model performance to predict vehicle damage extent using confusion matrix and key predictors.
